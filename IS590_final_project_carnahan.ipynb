    "Aerial imagery has been used for many years, [predating even the airplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_photography), as people have used aerial perspectives for many industries.  One usecase in particular is for quickly accounting for how land is partitioned into uses such as farming, forestry, urbanization, roadways, etc. Flood planning utilize this distribution of land use to determine rainfall absorption and runoff for hydrology models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For almost a century, measurement of land use has utilized a process called photogrammetry to extract surface areas of land use categories by measuring aerial photos using trigonometry.  This process is still quite effective, but is dependent on knowing the precise altitude above ground and camera intrinsics.  In the past few decades, a new technology called LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) leverages numerous laser pulses to scan terrain from the air, and return very accurate representation of features on the ground.  The data this produces is called a **pointcloud**, which is a 3-dimensional array of points in a Cartesian grid.  Further, this pointcloud undergoes a classification process using a standard called [American Society for Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing v1.4](http://www.asprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/LAS_1_4_r14.pdf).  This standard is used to delineate land use categories below, either through manual categorization or machine learning, to about 20 categories.  In the flood planning use case, typically the three categories used for hydrology modeling are: vegetation, road surfaces, and ground.  \n",

    "_As pointclouds are classified 3-dimensional XYZ points using ASCII format, and are generally several gigabytes to terrabytes in size.  My hypothesis is that we can use Numpy to analyze these points to more quickly determine land use surface area, as Numpy is designed for n-dimension vectorization, and efficiently leverages memory for quick analysis.  If this approach is successful, it could substitute the numerous hours of manual measurement of aerial photography to determine vegegation and road surface area for flood modeling._"

'scipy.spatial' has a method called ConvexHull, which we've seen previously in IS-590; however, this is a little different.  Even though the method is called ConvexHull, when given a 3D numpy array, the method actually peforms what is called a Delaunay triangulation invoked from Qhull class parent.  Effectively it connects the points with edges to create small triangle facets, and then calculates the area of each small triangle.  This has the added benefit over a simple aerial overlay in that Delaunay will also include additional area as it considers the z-axis in addition to just the x & y axis.  But there is bad news...\n",

A function that is used in pointcloud utilities (but not present in scipy) is to restrict the Delaunay to a preset threshold of \"nearest neighbors\", which results in **MANY** large facet areas to be calculated and inflating our area results.
