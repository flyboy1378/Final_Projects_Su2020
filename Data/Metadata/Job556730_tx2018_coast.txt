Your request was large enough to be cut into tiles.
The tiles are named either as quarter quads or a smaller variation. Quarter quad naming is YYXXXyx indicating the southeast corner location where
        YY = integer latitude
        XXX = integer longitude (positive west)
        y = a letter (a-h) representing 1/8 degree of latitude (a = 0, h = 0.875).
        x = a number (1-8) representing 1/8 degree of longitude
Thus, quarter quad 42082b5 has its southeast corner at 42.125N 82.5W.

The scheme for smaller tiles is YYXXX_yy_xx, where
        yy = hundredths of a degree of latitude
        xx = hundredths of a degree of longitude
Thus, tile 42082_12_50 has its southeast corner at 42.12N 82.5W.
